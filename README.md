# Main description
After learning frontend, backend and about databases, i try my best to make a full web applcation here using the flask framework.

## Note
Well, at the moment of writing this i still didn't learn all of backend and barely started learning about databases, so it will take a while so i start investing time here, but when i do the results will be good. The reason why i discontinued the library application i was going to take time to develop, is the same reason i won't be investing time on this repo for now, but i will come up with something else when i start working here.

## This repo is scrapped.
Since i found something clear to do with programming, i don't have reasons to invest time in this repository anymore, though i am going to still be active in the html-and-css repo atleast for a while.
